    The scoreCodeType in the ModelProperties.json file should be labelled as 'Python'.
    The file associated with the 'score' role should be a Python file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zip_path : string or Path object
        Location of files in the SAS Viya 3.5 model zip directory.
    python_score_code : string, optional
        File name of the Python score code. If None, then the file name is assumed to be
        the only Python file in the zip_path. An error is raised if this is not the

    Returns
    -------
    score_resource : list
        File name(s) of the score resource file.
    python_score_code : string
        File name of the Python score code file.

    Raises
    ------
    SyntaxError
        If no python_score_code name is provided, but there are multiple Python
        files in the zip_path, then a SyntaxError is raised asking for further
        clarification as to which file is the Python score code.
